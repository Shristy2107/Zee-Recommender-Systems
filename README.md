# Zee-Recommender-Systems

Case study offers an opportunity to delve into the complex and highly relevant eld of recommender systems, a cornerstone of modern AIdriven platforms. It will help to explore collaborative ltering techniques, both item-based and user-based, and understand their applications in
real-world scenarios. The project will cover a range of concepts including Pearson Correlation, Cosine Similarity, and Matrix Factorization,
providing a comprehensive learning experience in building recommender systems. We will gain hands-on experience in building as well as
evaluating these systems, honing skills that are highly sought after in the eld of data science and machine learning.
